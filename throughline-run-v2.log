[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular episodic semantic mapping for goal-oriente - The candidate focuses on modular episodic object-level maps from egocentric views for ObjectNav exploration, which shares semantic mapping themes but does not directly extend the seed's specific topological SLAM with node-based semantic features and coarse geometry, making it more of a topical neighbor than a direct technical descendant.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2521
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Leveraging learned semantic priors on object co-lo - The candidate leverages general semantic priors on object co-locations for exploration policies, which could draw from broad scene understanding literature rather than directly extending the seed's specific neural topological SLAM representations with node semantics and coarse geometry.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Domain-agnostic modular system design for sim-to-r - The candidate focuses on sim-to-real transfer via modular design for object-goal navigation, which shares the broad navigation domain but does not directly build on or require the seed's specific neural topological SLAM with semantic features and coarse geometry.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Global transformer attention for differentiable sp - The candidate uses transformers for global attention in map-based planning, which does not directly build on the seed's specific neural topological SLAM representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometry, but rather applies general transformer techniques to a mapping context that could stem from broader vision/planning literature.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular end-to-end frameworks with pre-trained dif - The candidate's modular differentiable mappers and transformer planners do not directly build on the seed's specific topological representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometry, relying instead on general neural mapping and planning techniques that could stem from broader SLAM or transformer literature.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Attention-driven alternatives to iterative convolu - The candidate focuses on attention mechanisms replacing convolutional planners in a general sense for manipulation and navigation, without directly building on or requiring the seed paper's specific topological representations, semantic features, or SLAM methods.

         └─ Same core authors (Chaplot, Salakhutdinov), direct continuation from CMU lab; modular explicit semantic map building and semantic search policy extends topological mapping with semantics and long-term memory for navigation
       [2021] SEAL: Self-supervised Embodied Active Learning using Explora...
         └─ Core authors (Chaplot, Gupta, Salakhutdinov); explicitly builds 3D semantic maps for exploration, labeling, and Object Goal Navigation improvement; direct extension of semantic topological mapping and memory
       [2022] Navigating to objects in the real world
         └─ Chaplot/Malik continuing work; empirical extension of modular explicit semantic mapping/exploration to real-world ObjectNav, validates and deploys lineage's architectural philosophy (modular > end-to-end)
       [2023] GOAT: GO to Any Thing
         └─ Same lab/authors (Dhruv Shah, Sriram Yenamandra from 2022 lineage paper; Théophile Gervet, Mukul Khanna overlap with group), direct continuation with instance-aware semantic memory for lifelong navigation to specific object instances, matching explicit semantic long-term memory philosophy
       [2023] Navigating to Objects Specified by Images
         └─ Overlapping authors/lab (Théophile Gervet from GOAT/candidate 1; Karmesh Yadav, Austin S. Wang, Chris Paxton in group), modular architecture with semantic map projection for instance localization/re-identification, extends object navigation approach from lineage (e.g., 2022 paper)
       [2024] GOAT-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation
         └─ Same authors/lab as GOAT (already in lineage), direct extension via benchmark for the GOAT task; emphasizes explicit vs. implicit scene memories and lifelong navigation, continuing explicit semantic long-term memory and modular architectural philosophy
       [2024] Embodied-RAG: General non-parametric Embodied Memory for Ret...
         └─ Shared core author Ruslan Salakhutdinov from seed paper; continues lineage with structured long-term semantic memory (semantic forest) for embodied navigation, aligning with high-fidelity graphs and memory philosophy

2. End-to-end mapless navigation policies (transformer-based, embodiment-agnostic, no explicit mapping)
   Spawned from: "Neural Topological SLAM for Visual Navigation" (2020)
   Papers in thread: 2
     → [2020] Neural Topological SLAM for Visual Navigation
       [2021] Differentiable Spatial Planning using Transformers
         └─ Direct continuation by lead author Chaplot; evolves seed's neural navigation to transformer-based (SPT) differentiable planning in end-to-end mapless framework without ground-truth maps; matches core philosophy of end-to-end mapless transformer policies; authors would cite seed as direct ancestor
