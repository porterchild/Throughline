[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular semantic mapping and goal-conditioned expl - The candidate originates from a distinct GT/Meta FAIR lab lineage with modular episodic maps for ObjectNav, lacking a clear intellectual descent from the CMU seed's topological SLAM approach despite broad semantic mapping similarities.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2928
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Semantic priors on object co-occurrences and scene - The candidate focuses on semantic priors and relative arrangements independent of mapping for exploration planning, diverging from the seed and current thread's fundamental DNA of building hybrid geometric-semantic topological maps for navigation.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Domain-agnostic modular designs enabling sim-to-re - The candidate emphasizes domain-agnostic modular designs and sim-to-real transfer for object goal navigation without referencing topological maps, semantic features, or hybrid geometric-semantic representations central to the seed and current CMU thread, indicating only broad domain overlap rather than shared intellectual DNA or lineage.

[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2941
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - End-to-end deep RL policies mapping raw sensors to - The candidate represents an end-to-end deep RL approach from the Meta AI Habitat lineage, which shares only the broad domain of visual navigation but lacks any clear intellectual descent from the CMU Robotics seed's hybrid semantic-topological mapping philosophy or techniques.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - UT Austin Vision Lab lineage: Plug & play modular  - The candidate's focus on plug-and-play modular transfer learning for zero-shot adaptation lacks a clear tie to the seed's topological SLAM representations or philosophy, representing a distinct modular policy lineage from UT Austin rather than a descendant or refinement of neural topological mapping.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2917
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Meta FAIR Habitat lineage: Large-scale end-to-end  - The candidate's end-to-end RL approach in Meta FAIR Habitat lacks the seed paper's core DNA of topological map-building with semantic features and supervised SLAM, representing an unrelated technique from a distinct lab lineage focused on benchmarks and scaling rather than mapping refinements.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2915
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Multi-modal goal-conditioned navigation lineage: P - The candidate focuses on modular multi-modal goal encoders for general goal-conditioned navigation without evident ties to the seed's topological SLAM/mapping or the current thread's hierarchical map-based planning for ObjectNav, sharing only the broad navigation domain.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Meta AI Habitat lab lineage: Closed-vocabulary Obj - The candidate's RL-based (DD-PPO, distillation) approach for closed-vocabulary ObjectNav benchmarks lacks the seed paper's core DNA of neural topological mapping/SLAM with semantic-geometric representations, representing instead a distinct model-free RL track from Meta Habitat without clear intellectual descent.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2882
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - HM3D-OVON lineage (Naoki Yokoyama / independent):  - The HM3D-OVON candidate focuses on VLM-driven visuo-semantic search for open-vocabulary ObjectNav from an independent lab, lacking clear ties to the seed's neural topological SLAM philosophy or map-based representations and overlapping broadly with ObjectNav without specific heritage.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2856
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Vision-Language Model (VLM) fusion for robust embo - The candidate's VLM/CLIP-based open-set detection and goal-conditioned policies represent a foundation model integration trend from vision-language communities, lacking the seed's core DNA of topological/semantic map-building and hierarchical map planning, making it a distinct architectural thread without clear lineage descent.
