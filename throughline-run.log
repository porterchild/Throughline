[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Object Goal Navigation in Unseen Environments - Object goal navigation typically relies on object detection and exploration strategies rather than directly extending the seed paper's specific neural topological SLAM with semantic features and coarse geometry for image-goal navigation, making it related work in the navigation domain but not a direct technical descendant.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2455
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Goal-Oriented Semantic Exploration with Episodic S - The candidate focuses on episodic semantic maps for goal-oriented exploration, which employs a distinct mapping architecture unrelated to the seed's specific topological representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometric edges, making it topical neighbors rather than a direct extension.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2468
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Learning Semantic Priors for Efficient Exploration - The candidate focuses on semantic priors for exploration and sim-to-real transfer, which shares the broad use of semantics in navigation but does not directly extend the seed's specific topological representations with node semantic features and coarse geometric edges for SLAM.

[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2507
