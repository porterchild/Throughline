[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Behavior Tree Frameworks for Adaptive Semantic Tas - The candidate Behavior Tree frameworks for aerial robot task coordination lack a clear intellectual descent from the seed's neural topological SLAM for visual navigation or ties to the current volumetric semantic mapping thread, representing a generic high-level control paradigm without specific alignment to the seed domain's mapping/navigation philosophy or lab lineages.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - DUSt3R lineage at Inria/collaborators: Regression  - The candidate directly describes the core DUSt3R approach (canonical point map regression from image pairs), which is already encompassed by the current Inria geometry team thread focused on feed-forward transformers for dense multi-view reconstruction, making it redundant rather than a distinct lineage or descendant of the seed navigation paper.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - DUSt3R direct architectural lineage: End-to-end tr - DUSt3R represents a direct architectural evolution (feed-forward to transformers) within the same CVLab EPFL lab's pointmap regression lineage and philosophy of synchronized pointmap prediction for 3D/4D reconstruction, making it redundant with the current thread rather than a meaningfully distinct research story.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2782
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Scalable reconstruction thread: Memory-augmented e - The candidate is a memory-augmented scalability extension maintaining the exact DUSt3R philosophy and CVLab EPFL lab lineage of the current thread, representing incremental complexity reduction rather than a major divergent architectural branch or separate research story.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2793
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Neural foundation for SfM/SLAM integration: Hybrid - The candidate extends the current CVLab EPFL pointmap regression lineage (explicitly MUSt3R-style) to SfM/SLAM applications without introducing a distinct lab, philosophy, or major architectural divergence from the existing thread.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting lineage: Uses canoni - The candidate focuses on dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting for object animation, which lacks any clear intellectual descent from or connection to the seed paper's topological SLAM for visual navigation, and merely extends Gaussian Splatting in a way redundant to the current thread's 3D reconstruction paradigm without forming a distinct navigation-related lineage.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - Feed-Forward Deterministic Models for Sparse-View  - The candidate represents a major parallel paradigm to the current diffusion-based multi-view finetuning thread—deterministic feed-forward models versus generative diffusion—for sparse-view 3D reconstruction/novel view synthesis, warranting separation as a distinct architectural lineage in the 3D perception domain adjacent to navigation.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Video diffusion models adapted for high-fidelity n - The candidate is a minor architectural variation within video diffusion models for novel view synthesis, overlapping heavily with the current thread's focus on generative multi-modal view generation for 3D consistency and lacking a clear tie to the seed paper's topological SLAM philosophy or lab lineage.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2548

[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2535
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Iterative optimization of 3D Gaussian Splatting re - The candidate combines diffusion-generated frames with 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene reconstruction, which lacks a clear intellectual descent from the seed's topological SLAM for navigation and overlaps architecturally with the current thread's generative diffusion for 3D-consistent novel views, making it redundant rather than a distinct lineage.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Fused view-time attention in 4D video diffusion mo - The candidate focuses on architectural innovations in 4D video diffusion generation from a distinct 4Real-Video lab lineage, lacking any clear intellectual descent, philosophical tie, or domain overlap with the seed paper's neural topological SLAM for visual navigation or the current thread's sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Feedforward 4D Gaussian reconstruction: Extends 3D - The candidate is a specific extension to 4D within feedforward deterministic reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting, lacking a clear tie to the seed's topological SLAM philosophy for navigation and appearing redundant as a variation on the current sparse-view 3D reconstruction thread rather than a distinct research story.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2606
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Integrated feedforward 4D scene generation pipelin - The candidate focuses on holistic 4D scene generation with diffusion and Gaussians from the 4Real series, lacking any clear intellectual descent, topological/semantics philosophy, lab lineage, or navigation-specific tie to the seed paper's visual navigation domain, and extends the current 3D reconstruction thread without forming a distinctly separate research story.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Mesh-Augmented LRMs: End-to-end differentiable mes - The candidate is a direct extension of the current LRM thread (fine-tuning NeRF LRMs for mesh output) rather than a clear descendant of the seed's topological SLAM for navigation or a major divergent paradigm, making it redundant within the existing architectural lineage.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2814
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Efficient LRM Architectures: Simplified designs an - The candidate represents minor efficiency optimizations (simplified designs and training strategies) within the existing LRM thread's transformer-based 3D reconstruction paradigm, lacking distinct lab lineage, philosophical divergence, or ties to the seed paper's topological SLAM approach.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Transformer-based Large Reconstruction Models (LRM - The candidate is a minor architectural refinement within the existing LRM thread (emphasizing transformer blocks and scene-scale evolution), lacking a clear intellectual descent from the seed paper's topological SLAM for navigation and appearing redundant rather than a distinct research story.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2797
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting predictors: Dir - The candidate introduces a major divergent architectural thread—feed-forward prediction of Gaussian Splatting primitives versus transformer-based NeRF regression in LRMs—representing a distinct parallel paradigm in direct neural 3D reconstruction from sparse views, warranting separate tracking in the same broad domain of efficient spatial representations.
