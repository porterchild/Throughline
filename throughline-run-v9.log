[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Goal-Oriented Semantic Exploration (GOSE) lineage  - GOSE focuses on episodic semantic maps and object arrangement priors for ObjectNav exploration, which shares the lab and modularity but does not directly extend the seed's specific topological graph representations with semantic node features and coarse geometric edges for image-goal navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3017
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Sim-to-Real Modular Navigation transfer lineage: D - The candidate focuses on general sim-to-real transfer for ObjectNav using domain-agnostic modular systems, which shares the broad navigation domain and real-world transfer goal but does not directly build on or require the seed's specific topological representations with semantic node features and coarse geometric edges.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3006
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Semantic Priors for Scene Understanding in Navigat - The candidate focuses on learning object co-occurrences as semantic priors to bias exploration frontiers in generic mapping-based planners, which shares the navigation domain but does not directly extend the seed's specific topological graph representations with semantic node features and coarse geometric edges.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - End-to-End Learning Navigation: Reactive deep neur - The candidate pursues end-to-end reactive policies that explicitly bypass mapping and planning—directly opposing the seed's core topological representations with semantic nodes and geometric edges—sharing only the broad image-goal navigation domain without building on its specific technical contributions.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3121
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular Learning Navigation: Enriching classical g - The candidate emphasizes enriching classical geometric pipelines with modular learned components in a CMU/Meta Habitat lineage, sharing broad themes like modularity and sim-to-real but not directly building on the seed's specific neural topological graphs with semantic nodes and coarse edges, which would likely be cited only as related work.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3100
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Real-World Navigation Benchmarks: Large-scale empi - The candidate focuses on general real-world benchmarks and evaluations for navigation paradigms to address sim-to-real gaps, without directly building on or extending the seed paper's specific topological representations, semantic node features, or coarse geometric edges.

[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3005
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - UT Austin modular architectures disentangling perc - The candidate's focus on interaction-free supervised learning on passive datasets and disentangling perception from navigation using generic semantic maps does not directly extend the seed's specific topological SLAM with semantic node features, coarse geometric edges, and active map maintenance under noise, representing a distinct architectural approach from a different lab rather than a direct intellectual descendant.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2991
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Interaction-free learning paradigms for ObjectNav  - The candidate relies on top-down metric maps and supervised potentials for ObjectNav, which does not directly build on or require the seed's specific topological graph representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometric edges for image-goal navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2977
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Potential field methods conditioned on semantics f - The candidate relies on classical potential field methods rather than directly extending the seed's specific topological graph representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometric edges, making it a topical neighbor in navigation rather than a direct technical descendant.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Monolithic end-to-end RL approaches for universal  - The candidate focuses on monolithic end-to-end RL from PointNav/ObjectNav baselines without decomposition, which does not directly build on or require the seed's specific topological SLAM with semantic node features and coarse geometric edges, representing an unrelated architectural paradigm rather than a direct extension.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3023
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular architectures for GOAT tasks, combining pe - The candidate focuses on general modular architectures for GOAT tasks using Habitat-style hierarchical systems and broad Meta FAIR scene representations, without directly building on the seed paper's specific neural topological SLAM techniques like semantic node features and coarse geometric edges for map maintenance.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3039
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Lifelong and continual learning tracks in embodied - The candidate focuses on lifelong/continual learning and memory mechanisms from continual RL lineages at Berkeley/Stanford, sharing only the broad embodied navigation domain without directly building on or requiring the seed's specific topological SLAM representations, semantic node features, or coarse geometric mapping.
