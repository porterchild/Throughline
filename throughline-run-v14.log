[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Potential function-based exploration tracks: High- - The candidate potential function-based exploration lacks a clear tie to the CMU Gupta lab lineage or the seed paper's topological semantic mapping philosophy, appearing as a generic classical-to-learning evolution without distinct intellectual descent or major divergence specific to the modular semantic exploration thread.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2720
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - Low-compute alternatives to RL in embodied navigat - The candidate introduces a distinct lab-agnostic lineage focused on imitation/supervised pretraining with passive data and map-based potentials as low-compute ObjectNav alternatives to RL, representing a parallel modular paradigm to the CMU Gupta thread's episodic semantic maps and object co-occurrence exploration.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Behavior Tree Frameworks for Adaptive Aerial Robot - The candidate Behavior Tree Frameworks for aerial robotics lack a clear intellectual descent from the seed's neural topological SLAM for visual navigation, represent a generic hierarchical planning paradigm without ties to semantic mapping or the seed's philosophy/domain, and do not form a distinct lineage story linked to the user's seeds or current thread.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Frontier-based exploration lineage from CMU/MIT, e - The candidate is a minor variation on frontier-based semantic exploration already covered in the current CMU/FAIR thread (e.g., SemExp), sharing the same core architectural paradigm and lab lineage without a clear tie to the seed's neural topological SLAM approach.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2699
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - Open-vocabulary perception lineage from Stanford/B - The candidate introduces a distinct Stanford/Berkeley lineage using open-vocabulary zero-shot CLIP-like perception for sparse 3D semantics, representing a major divergent architectural paradigm from the CMU/FAIR modular frontier-based exploration with learned semantics, while echoing the seed's sparse topological philosophy with semantics for navigation.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Emerging unified ray-voxel frontier architectures  - The candidate's ray-voxel frontier architecture for task-agnostic mapping lacks a clear intellectual descent from the seed's neural topological SLAM with semantics, represents a generic efficient mapping variant without distinct ties to the domain's core philosophy, and overlaps architecturally with the current modular frontier thread rather than forming a separate research story.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - VLM-augmented modular navigation: Uses VLMs for se - The candidate introduces a distinct hybrid modular architecture integrating VLMs with classical robotics modules (mapping/frontiers/planning), forming a major divergent branch from the current thread's zero-shot end-to-end VLM-driven value maps, while echoing the seed's modular topological-semantic philosophy in the same navigation domain.
