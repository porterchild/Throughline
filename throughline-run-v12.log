[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Interaction-free learning lineage: Passive supervi - The candidate's interaction-free supervised policy learning for exploration lacks a clear tie to the seed paper's topological SLAM approach, BAIR lab lineage, or semantic-geometric mapping philosophy, representing a generic navigation paradigm without distinct descent or divergence in the specified domain.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2669
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Learned potential functions lineage: Modern deep l - The candidate revives classical potential fields on top-down maps, lacking a clear intellectual descent from the seed's neural topological SLAM with semantic nodes/edges or the BAIR lab lineage, and instead forms a separate classical-to-DL paradigm without strong domain-specific ties to image-goal navigation in novel environments.
