[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Low-compute modular architectures for ObjectNav: H - The candidate extends the same modular semantic mapping paradigm for ObjectNav with a low-compute efficiency focus but lacks a distinct lab lineage or major architectural divergence from the current CMU Gupta thread on modularity and semantic reasoning.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2736
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Learned potential fields lineage in embodied navig - The candidate's learned potential fields approach lacks a clear intellectual descent from the seed's topological SLAM with semantics or the current Gupta lab's modular semantic mapping thread, representing a classical robotics paradigm evolution without distinct ties to their philosophy, lab lineage, or domain-specific mapping focus.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - LLM/VLM-driven failure detection and replanning in - The candidate focuses on high-level LLM/VLM task planning and failure recovery from the distinct BAIR/Google SayCan lineage, lacking a clear intellectual descent from the seed's topological SLAM for visual navigation or meaningful distinction from the current VLM-augmented scene graph thread beyond general semantic reasoning.
