[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3361
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Explicit neural topological mapping with semantic  - The candidate describes a variation on explicit neural topological mapping with semantic features for navigation tasks (episodic/modular maps for object nav) that aligns closely with the current Chaplot thread's hierarchical graphs using semantic node embeddings and coarse geometry, making it redundant rather than meaningfully distinct.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3324
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Foundation model approaches without explicit maps: - The candidate relies on unrelated foundation model techniques for implicit navigation without explicit topological maps or semantic-geometric node/edge structures, making it a parallel paradigm rather than a direct extension of the seed paper's specific contributions.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 3288
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Large-scale RL-trained navigation policies: Scalin - The candidate relies on end-to-end transformer-based RL scaling without maps or planning, which does not directly build on the seed's specific topological graph representations with semantic nodes and geometric edges, representing an unrelated architectural approach rather than a technical extension.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Foundation model approaches for scene understandin - The candidate foundation model approaches without explicit SLAM/maps do not directly build on the seed's specific neural topological SLAM architecture with semantic nodes and coarse geometry, representing an unrelated technique in the same broad navigation domain rather than a direct extension.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Human-robot teaming frameworks leveraging shared s - The candidate focuses on human-robot teaming with natural language and shared perception, which shares the broad domain of semantic perception for planning but does not directly build on or require the seed paper's specific neural topological SLAM architecture with semantic nodes and coarse geometry.
