[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - RL-based fine-tuning of MLLMs into VLA policies us - The candidate focuses on RL fine-tuning of foundation models into VLA policies, representing a generic end-to-end paradigm shift with no clear tie to the seed's topological SLAM approach, Habitat simulator lineage, or Meta FAIR lab, making it redundant as a broad robotics trend rather than a distinct descendant or divergent branch in the same domain.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2652
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - End-to-end training of interactive embodied agents - The candidate focuses on interactive end-to-end agent training with human clarification in household tasks, lacking any clear intellectual descent from the seed's topological SLAM for non-interactive visual navigation or the current Habitat simulator lineage for humanoid physics.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2636
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Benchmarking and methods for multi-object rearrang - The candidate focuses on multi-object rearrangement benchmarks and methods rather than being a clear descendant of the seed's topological SLAM navigation approach or philosophy, and it overlaps redundantly with the current Meta FAIR Habitat simulator thread without representing a major divergent architectural branch.
