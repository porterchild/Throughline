[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Real-time Clio pipeline for constructing hierarchi - The candidate focuses on a distinct Clio pipeline for hierarchical 3D scene graphs, which shares the broad domain of spatial modeling but does not directly extend the seed's specific neural topological representations with semantic node features and coarse geometric interconnections for SLAM-based navigation.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs)  - The candidate focuses on real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs, which represent a distinct representation paradigm with finer-grained metric geometry and multi-modal updates rather than directly extending the seed's specific coarse topological maps with semantic node features for SLAM-based navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2484
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 3DSGs - The candidate uses 3D scene graphs to ground VLMs for embodied QA, which shares the broad theme of semantic spatial modeling but does not directly build on or require the seed's specific neural topological SLAM methods for online map building and image-goal navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2487
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Hierarchical planning exploiting 3DSG structure fo - The candidate introduces hierarchical planning on 3DSG structures, which is a distinct representation and technique not directly building on the seed's specific neural topological SLAM with semantic node features and coarse geometric edges, making it topical overlap rather than direct intellectual lineage.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Geometric-prompt dynamic separation for distinguis - The candidate focuses on Gaussian-based geometric consistency for static/dynamic separation, which does not directly build on the seed's specific topological representations, semantic node features, or supervised map maintenance under noisy actuation, but rather addresses a general scene decomposition challenge applicable to many vision systems.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2498
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Dynamic-static composite representation integratin - The candidate's use of 3D static and 4D dynamic Gaussians for scene mapping relies on radiance field techniques unrelated to the seed paper's specific topological representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometry, making it a topical neighbor in SLAM rather than a direct extension.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2519
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Progressive pose refinement and motion consistency - The candidate focuses on low-level pose refinement and motion consistency losses for tracking, which are general SLAM frontend techniques unrelated to the seed's specific topological representations with semantic features and supervised map building/maintenance under noisy actuation.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Theoretical analysis of Q-learning in state-only e - The candidate is a general theoretical result on tabular Q-learning in discrete MDPs that does not build on or reference the seed paper's specific neural topological representations, semantic features, or supervised SLAM methods for visual navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2539
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Development of Latent Action Q-learning (LAQ), an  - LAQ is a general offline RL method using latent actions and future prediction that shares the broad navigation domain but does not directly build on or require the seed paper's specific topological representations, semantic features, or supervised SLAM techniques.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2557
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Empirical evaluation of LAQ across diverse environ - The candidate focuses on empirical evaluation of an unrelated method called LAQ with no mention of the seed paper's specific neural topological representations, semantic features, or SLAM techniques, making it a topical neighbor rather than a direct extension.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Self-supervised foundation model training for dept - The candidate proposes a general self-supervised DINO-style pretraining method for depth image representations that is independent of the seed paper's specific supervised topological SLAM architecture and navigation techniques, making it merely related work in the broad domain of geometric/semantic representations rather than a direct extension.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2504
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Novel input normalization strategy to preserve met - The candidate proposes a general input normalization strategy for depth data that addresses multi-scale metric preservation, which does not directly build on the seed paper's specific topological representations, semantic features, or supervised SLAM methods, but could apply to any depth-processing vision system.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2514
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Distillation into compact models and evaluation on - The candidate relies on generic techniques like model distillation and sim-to-real evaluation that could apply to any navigation system, without directly building on the seed paper's specific neural topological representations or SLAM methods.

[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2523
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Advancement in embodied AI with full-kinematics ag - The candidate focuses on general sim-to-real advancements via kinematics and physics simulation, which is a broad embodied AI challenge unrelated to the seed's specific neural topological representations and SLAM methods for image-goal navigation.
