[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Modular system for object goal navigation using ep - The candidate focuses on episodic semantic maps for object-goal navigation in a modular system, which shares the broad theme of semantic spatial modeling but does not directly extend the seed's specific neural topological SLAM with node-based semantic features and coarse geometry for image-goal navigation.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2506
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Goal-oriented semantic exploration leveraging lear - The candidate focuses on goal-oriented exploration with object arrangement priors, which shares the semantic navigation domain but does not directly extend the seed's specific topological representations, semantic node architectures, or SLAM methods, making it topical related work rather than a direct technical descendant.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Development of Spatial Planning Transformers (SPT) - The candidate introduces transformers for differentiable path planning focused on long-range dependencies, which does not directly build on the seed paper's specific topological representations with semantic nodes and coarse geometric links, but rather represents a distinct architectural shift unrelated to the seed's core methods.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2524
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Data-driven learning of planners from past data to - The candidate focuses on generic data-driven planner learning from past trajectories to avoid full-map optimization, which does not directly extend the seed's specific topological graph construction with semantic nodes and coarse edges, but rather represents a broader planning paradigm applicable to many navigation systems.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2529
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - End-to-end framework integrating pre-trained SPTs  - The candidate's end-to-end integration of pre-trained SPTs with mapping for OOD generalization does not directly build on the seed's specific neural topological representations using semantic node features and coarse geometric connections, but instead pursues a broadly applicable technique in the shared domain of unknown-environment navigation.
