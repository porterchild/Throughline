[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Cross-Embodiment Fleet Learning and Real-World Dep - The candidate focuses on broad cross-embodiment fleet learning for locomotion across robot types with no specific connection to the seed's image-goal visual navigation or topological SLAM approach, making it a generic robotics scaling method rather than a clear descendant, parallel paradigm, or non-redundant track in the seed's domain.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Berkeley-led open-source VLA models: Philosophy of - The candidate directly builds on the Open X-Embodiment datasets by pretraining Berkeley-led VLA models within the same multi-lab lineage and generalist policy philosophy, making it a continuation rather than a meaningfully distinct research thread.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of VLAs: Focus on  - The candidate focuses on generic parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for broad VLAs in robotics, lacking a clear intellectual descent from the seed's topological SLAM for visual navigation or distinct separation from the OXE pretraining thread beyond a minor practical extension.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Open X-Embodiment unified dataset scaling for gene - The candidate is a scaling extension of the existing Open X-Embodiment thread focused on dataset aggregation for generalist policies, lacking a distinct lab lineage or architectural divergence while sharing no clear intellectual tie to the seed paper's topological SLAM navigation approach.

[Throughline] Sub-thread check: CREATE - OpenVLA lineage: Large-scale open-source pretraine - The candidate represents a distinct lab/author lineage (Stanford/UNC/Max Planck collaborations vs. AI2-led) within the OpenVLA thread, combined with a major architectural divergence via scalable RL post-training (vs. optimized fine-tuning like OFT), forming a separate research story in the end-to-end VLA paradigm for embodied tasks traceable to the seed's navigation domain.
