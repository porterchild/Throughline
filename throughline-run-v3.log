[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - FAIR Habitat lab lineage: Modular episodic semanti - The candidate focuses on FAIR Habitat's modular episodic semantic mapping for ObjectNav (a distinct task from image-goal navigation) with efficient exploration, sharing only the broad simulation-based navigation domain rather than directly building on the seed's specific neural topological SLAM architecture.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2763
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - CMU robotics lab lineage: Goal-conditioned modular - The candidate focuses on goal-conditioned modular systems, sim-to-real transfer, and ObjectNav deployment from CMU, which shares the broad navigation domain but does not directly build on or depend on the seed's specific neural topological SLAM representations and methods.
[Throughline] callLLM called with prompt length: 2813
[Throughline] Sub-thread check: SKIP - Visual reasoning lab lineage (Parikh/Batra/Efros): - The candidate relies on VQA/scene graph priors for semantic scene understanding from a distinct lab lineage (Parikh/Batra/Efros), without directly building on or requiring the seed's specific topological SLAM representations, node semantics, or map-building methods.
